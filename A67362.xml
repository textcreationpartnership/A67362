            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>SIR, my Muſe bid you welcome when you come,</l>
               <l>And now's concern'd at your going home;</l>
               <l>Love alwayes tending to a noble eye,</l>
               <l>Like to a Shepherd looking on the Sky.</l>
               <l>Your comely perſon, and ingenious parts</l>
               <l>Has by a Magick-Spell conjur'd up hearts:</l>
               <l>So they did appear, and ſhew their faces,</l>
               <l>Towards you, when in your Pomp and Laces.</l>
               <l>Th' <hi>Morocco Ambaſſador</hi> th' Nation did cry,</l>
               <l>Was a man truly worthy of Glory;</l>
               <l>That where he went wanted no Servants at all,</l>
               <l>People would be with him, both low or tall;</l>
               <l>They thought they could not do too much for him,</l>
               <l>A man as liberal as a flowing Spring,</l>
               <l>Reſolving to ſee this Ambaſſador great,</l>

               <l>I'm come, I've made a Peace with <hi>England</hi>'s King,</l>
               <l>In which, we both were pleaſed in every thing.</l>
               <l>I had the favour both of Court and City,</l>
               <l>And was beloved of all th' men called witty;</l>
               <l>And like Dove, I bring th' Olive-branch of Peace,</l>

               <l>For which you have th' thanks of each Engliſh heart,</l>
               <l>Paid to you as a man of Mighty Art;</l>

               <l> And even could deſire to live no more,</l>
               <l>Since true Love's gone, from off the Engliſh Shoar;</l>
               <l>Telling us, whether our joyes he great or ſmall,</l>
               <l>Are fleeting, as they are Terreſtrial.</l>
               <l>Fortune is ſhown upon a Globe of braſs</l>
               <l>And each worldly joy's like a piece of glaſs;</l>
               <l>Of ſmall ſubſtance, wanting a noble weight,</l>
               <l>It rides below, it's but of little height,</l>
               <l>Of ſmaller value, and of leſſer prize,</l>
               <l>Therefore, wit is all in all when 'tis wiſe.</l>
               <l>Since all things uncertain and inconſtant be,</l>
               <l>Like to the bird when on the Wing we ſee,</l>
               <l>Flies from the Oak, unto the Cherry Tree,</l>
               <l>And conſtant in nothing but in inconſtancy.</l>
               <l>Therefore in all things we muſt be content;</l>
               <l>Since that our Friends are to us ſtill but lent,</l>
               <l>And by th' Powers above to us are ſent,</l>
               <l>Shewing the wings of pleaſure, are its puniſhment.</l>
               <l>This Nature teaches from her motions high,</l>
               <l>And yields to us by her moſt beauteous eye;</l>
               <l>The day by conſtant motion moves into Night,</l>
               <l>Tacks but about, and throwes upon us Light;</l>
               <l>So by a repetition of Atoms doth return,</l>
               <l>That bright thing where firſt that it begun.</l>
               <l>The Swallow Travels, and hither doth come;</l>
               <l>When Winter riſes he then too goeth home:</l>
               <l>And th' faireſt Flower withereth away,</l>
               <l>For Nature does not alwayes work but play.</l>
               <l>So man is ſometimes here, and ſometimes there,</l>
               <l>Shewes but himſelf, and ſo doth diſappear.</l>
               <l>A lively Emblem of the things above,</l>
               <l>'Tis ſo below, for the Creations Love.</l>
               <l>The buſineſs is, mutation doth appear</l>
               <l>In Men, bruits, birds, and Planets of the Year.</l>
               <l>Thus every thing is given to revolution,</l>
               <l>By common inſtinct, and by Worldly motion;</l>
               <l>Friends and Relations all vaniſh away,</l>
               <l>As Countrey men when drunk, they wont make Hay,</l>
               <l>But tumble and toſs this way and th' other,</l>
               <l>Any where to ſee a neighbour or a brother;</l>
               <l>To drown ſadneſs, and their melancholly,</l>
